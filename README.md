## What Bash scripting should not be used for

Bash scripting is not suitable for complex applications or tasks requiring high processing power or extensive memory usage. It's not the best choice for programs requiring intricate error handling or high portability.

---

## What is an API

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.

---

## What is a REST API

A REST API, or Representational State Transfer API, is an architectural style for creating web APIs. It uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with resources (data) in a predictable manner.

---

## What are microservices

Microservices refer to an architectural approach where a software application is constructed as a collection of small, independent services. Each service performs a specific function and communicates with other services via APIs.

---

## What is the CSV format

CSV, or Comma-Separated Values, is a simple file format used to store tabular data. Each line in a CSV file represents a row, and columns are separated by commas (or other delimiters).

---

## What is the JSON format

JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight and human-readable data format. It is commonly used for exchanging data between a server and a web application. JSON represents data as key-value pairs in a structure similar to JavaScript objects.
